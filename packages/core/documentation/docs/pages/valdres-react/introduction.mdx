# Introduction

`valdres-react` builds on the vanilla js `valdres` package and adds various
hooks and the optional `<Provider />`.

## Quick Start

::::steps

### Install

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install valdres-react
```

```bash [bun]
bun add valdres-react
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add valdres-react
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm add valdres-react
```

### Create atoms and selectors

An `atom` contains a piece of state while a `selector` represents aggregated
state or slices of state based on one or more atoms. `atomFamily` and
`selectorFamily` are used when you have collections of similar objects that vary
based on input paramters like an id or filters.

In the example below we have the folling state:

-   `currentUserIdAtom` an atom that fetches and stores the currents user id
-   `userAtom` a atomFamily that stores user objects by userId
-   `userDisplayNameSelector` a selectorFamily that generates a display name
    based on the `userAtom` family

:::code-group

```tsx [currentUserIdAtom.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/state/atoms/currentUserIdAtom.ts]
```

```tsx [userAtom.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/state/atoms/userAtom.ts]
```

```tsx [userDisplayNameSelector.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/state/selectors/userDisplayNameSelector.ts]
```

:::

### Use the atoms and selectors in React

Once we have our atoms and selectors we can subscribe to them in our React
components.

:::code-group

```tsx [UserProfile.tsx]
// [!include ~/snippets/UserProfile.tsx]
```

```tsx [UserAvatar.tsx]
// [!include ~/snippets/UserAvatar.tsx]
```

:::

:::note[Result]

import { UserProfileWithReset } from "../../snippets/UserProfileWithReset"

<UserProfileWithReset />

### Provider mode (optional)

Unless you wrap your app in a `<Provider>` the default global store is used.
This is totaly fine. You can access the default store outside the react tree
with `getDefaultStore()` from the `valdres-react` package.

If you want more control or segregate your state across multiple stores you can
wrap any part of the React tree with a `<Provider>`. The Provider by default
creates a new store unless you provide your own store created using the
[`createStore()`](/react/api/createStore) function.

:::code-group

```tsx [App.tsx]
import { Provider } from "valdres-react"
import { store } from "./store"

export function App = ({ children }) {
    return <Provider store={store}>
        {children}
    <Provider>
}
```

```ts [store.ts]
import { createStore } from "valdres-react"

export const store = createStore()
```
