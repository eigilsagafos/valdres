title: useCommand
---

`useCommand` is a utility hook that simplifes subscribing to common keyboard
shortcuts. They will be mapped automatically based on operating system and will
by default call `preventDefault()` on the event to stop default browser
behaviour.

Available Commands

-   `Command.Undo`
-   `Command.Redo`
-   `Command.Save`

```jsx
import { useCommand } from "@valdres/hotkeys"

const Comp = () => {
    useCommand(Command.Save, () => {
        console.log("Saving")
    })
}
```

import { UseCommandExample } from "../../../../components/examples/UseCommandExample"

<UseCommandExample client:only />
