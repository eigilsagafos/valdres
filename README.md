# Valdres

```bash
bun install
```

## Releasing

Versioning and publishing is handled by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Each package versions independently.

**When you open a PR that changes a publishable package:**

```bash
bunx changeset
```

Pick the affected packages, the bump type (patch/minor/major), and write a short summary. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` file with your PR.

For PRs that touch publishable code but intentionally don't trigger a release (refactors, internal cleanup, docs):

```bash
bunx changeset --empty
```

This still generates a `.changeset/*.md` file — commit it like a regular changeset. The `Require changeset` check on each PR enforces that any change to a publishable package ships with a changeset (empty or otherwise).

When the PR merges to `main`, the `Publish` workflow opens (or updates) a **Version Packages** PR that applies the pending changesets, bumps versions, and updates CHANGELOGs. Merging that PR publishes the affected packages to npm.

To preview what publishing would do locally:

```bash
bun run verify-publish
```

The repo is currently in `beta` prerelease mode (`bunx changeset pre exit` to graduate to stable).

## Benchmarks

### Performance

valdres is benchmarked against [Jotai](https://github.com/pmndrs/jotai) (and a raw `Map` floor) on every PR via [Bencher](https://bencher.dev) — live, always-current latency per operation under both Bun (JavaScriptCore) and Node.js (V8):

**→ [bencher.dev/perf/valdres](https://bencher.dev/perf/valdres)**

Every PR from the repo gets a comment flagging any latency regression vs `main` (fork PRs are skipped — they can't read the upload key).
